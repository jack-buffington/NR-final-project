mapping01.m   - loads a ROS bag file and saves out velodyne messages (RUN FIRST)

extractRawData.m - loads messages.mat and extracts out the velodyne messages and saves it in 
		   a more accessable format (RUN SECOND)

convertExtractedData - Loads extractedData and plots a single sweep from the lidar (RUN THIRD)

getTransforms - % gets the TransForms from the tf 'sensor'

getTransforms02 - gets the TransForms from the lilred_velocity_controller/odom 'sensor'

extractDataFromMessages - function that when given a bag select of velodyne messages and a file 
		          offset, returns the data in the format of extractRawData.m

RUN_ME01.m - Takes multiple velodyne messages and attempts to combine them.

RUN_ME02.m - Colors a point cloud using a given image.

getLidarAroundTime.m - gives you XYZ points for the lidar scan closest to the given time

getTransformsAtTime - interpolates the transforms so that they give you the transform at the 
                      requested time.
processTransforms.m - converts the twist info into translation and rotation so that I don't 
                      have to integrate up to the needed time for each frame
